# The script creates a Xenon cluster by running xenon-host
# on the provided set of host addresses.
#
# The script makes the following assumptions about the
# environment it is being run on:
# - The script is kicked off from the xenon root directory
# - xenon-host package is built and can be found under
#   /xenon/xenon-host/target/.
# - The provided username/password credentials are valid
#   for all provided hosts.
# - The script is kicked off on a machine that has sshpass
#   installed locally.
# - Each host has ssh access enabled
# - Each host has NTP daemon installed and running.
